# Current paper result-to-source map

The recovered 16 October package has a 28-page manuscript, 52-page ESM 1 with S1–S15, and a 118-member ESM 2. It matches the requested full title and revision topics. The older S11-ending package is superseded for this map. Exact identities are in `MANUSCRIPT_SOURCE_VERIFICATION.md`; no manuscript was edited.

104 ESM 2 members with repository counterparts were compared byte for byte; all 104 match the verified baseline. The recovered numeric ledgers contain 545 main-source and 1,443 supplementary-source cells. An independent checker matched all 1,988 source strings/rounding rules to 25 aggregate sources and confirmed display presence in the recovered TeX/macros. This is not a guarantee about every prose number, PDF placement or scientific inference. The comparator ledger omits batch_n in 32 cell keys; its explicit preceding batch_n cell disambiguates the row, and the retained ledger is unchanged.

## Tested entry points and what they do

Run from the sanitized snapshot root in the documented CPython 3.12 environment. No current public tag distributes this candidate yet. The metadata-bearing original statistical-verification CSV is excluded; its separately named PUBLIC projection removes only the private source-path column and preserves all retained cell strings. The source index/curation adapter identifies that derivative explicitly.

| Code | Executable command | Expected output / dependencies / evidence tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V | `python scripts/verify_publication_results.py` and `python publication_release/verify_public_aggregates.py` | Console verification: 85 retained publication + 14 correction fingerprints; 47 exact curated views; 216 point/Holm contrasts; repeat/routing/selective arithmetic. Standard library for these checks. No patient data, fit or new bootstrap |
| M | `python publication_release/verify_manuscript_sources.py` | Console: 545 main + 1,443 supplementary scalar source/rounding checks. Reads the retained ledgers and tracked aggregate CSVs. No manuscript file needed; actual TeX display-presence check additionally accepts `--manuscript-dir` supplied locally |
| E | `python scripts/finalize_journal_handoff.py reconstruct --destination outputs/reviewer-tables` | 47 CSVs + 11 Markdown views under an empty output directory. Requires installed package/numpy/pandas and tracked sources; no private data or fitting. This reconstructs curated aggregate views, not the complete typeset PDF layouts |
| F | `python publication_release/paper_evidence/REGENERATE_FIGURES.py outputs/reviewer-figures` | Three paper PNG/PDF figures from tracked aggregate plot data/forced-panel CSV; matplotlib only, no private predictions or fitting. All three PNGs reproduced byte-identically in the isolated environment |
| C | `python publication_release/verify_cohort_counts.py --dataset pidd` (also sylhet/hospital130) | Independently recount eligible rows/events/predictors from separately downloaded, hash-verified raw data. No record-level output or fit. BRFSS requires its blocked CDC download; split membership is not reconstructed |

For every item below, **saved aggregate verification is public-input-capable in this candidate** (subject to its release approval). **Complete numerical reanalysis is not independently established from public inputs**: raw records, matching historical splits/predictions/models/calibrators and bootstrap distributions are absent or nonredistributed, and the exact historical source tree is missing. The commands verify or curate frozen evidence; none reruns model fitting. Required provider sources for any future raw-data work are OpenML 37 (PIDD), UCI 529 (Sylhet), UCI 296 (Hospital130), and CDC BRFSS 2015, with exact URLs/hashes in `config/data_sources.yaml`. Download status and platform limits are recorded in `FRESH_CLONE_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Supplementary tables S1–S15

These are semantic S-table sections in ESM 1; some span multiple physical LaTeX tables. They are not the older package's S11 survey-sensitivity numbering.

| S9 | All original runtime paired contrasts | analysis/journal_revision/07_RUNTIME_PAIRED_COMPARISONS.csv; results/final_publication/tables/statistical_comparisons.csv | Three policy contrasts per cohort/metric; conditional fitted-prediction bootstrap; raw draws remain private | V+M+E |
| S10 | SHAP ranks | results/final_publication/tables/shap_summary.csv | Saved model-specific aggregate ranks; individual SHAP values/models are private; no causal claim | V+M |
| S11 | Reduced-schema effects for all probability metrics | analysis/journal_revision/04_RETRAINED_PANEL_COMPARISON.csv; analysis/journal_revision/04_PANEL_PAIRED_CONTRASTS.csv | AUROC/AP/Brier/log loss; negative/inconclusive rows and full identity controls retained | V+M+E |
| S12 | Calibration/switching effects | analysis/journal_revision/05_CALIBRATION_SWITCHING_ABLATION.csv; analysis/journal_revision/05_ABLATION_PAIRED_CONTRASTS.csv | A/B/C/D points and five contrasts/cohort/metric; not the original three-policy family | V+M+E |

## Current paper figures

| Figure | Number represented | Authoritative input | Script / expected output | Public check versus reanalysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Accepted-runtime decile mean probability/event rate in separate cohort panels | `results/final_publication/figure/data/panel_a_calibration.csv`, exact copied input in `paper_evidence/figure_data/` | F; `outputs/reviewer-figures/Figure_1_Calibration.{png,pdf}` | Drawing from saved bins PASS; recreating bins from individuals BLOCKED |
| 2 | Endpoint-specific runtime/treat-all/treat-none net benefit over saved thresholds | `results/final_publication/figure/data/panel_b_decision_curves.csv`, exact copied input in `paper_evidence/figure_data/` | F; `outputs/reviewer-figures/Figure_2_Decision_Curves.{png,pdf}` | Drawing from saved aggregate curves PASS; independent prediction-derived utility/uncertainty BLOCKED |
| 3 | Full-minus-forced-panel AP against percentage of full-schema predictor count | `results/final_publication/tables/availability_panel_degradation.csv`, exact copy in `paper_evidence/04_SUPPLEMENTARY_TABLES/` | F; `outputs/reviewer-figures/Figure_3_Availability.{png,pdf}` | Drawing from saved aggregate values PASS; independent metric reanalysis BLOCKED |

The older consolidated figure and three plot-data CSVs remain frozen/hash-verified. The original prediction-consuming renderer is not the current public drawing entry point. Paper PDF byte identity may vary with embedded creation dates; all three tested PNG bytes exactly match the recovered paper artwork. No new scientific estimates or plot data were calculated.

## Additional complete aggregate evidence

BRFSS survey-weighted sensitivity, decision-curve intervals/contrasts, all benchmark paired comparisons, calibration choices, detailed cost/storage tables, PIDD forced-versus-runtime estimands and statistical reconstruction records remain identifiable under `results/final_publication/tables/` and `analysis/journal_revision/`. Their presence is not a claim that every row appears in the selected main/ESM display. Missing bootstrap arrays prevent a public independent recomputation of raw paired P values/CIs, although adjusted values can be checked from the retained raw P columns.

## Every curated table and exact source

The index below is generated from the public `TABLE_SOURCE_INDEX.json` (one entry explicitly identifies the metadata-only statistical projection); it preserves source identities, exact row selections and precision. E reconstructs all 47, including the 11 rounded Markdown views. M supplies the paper-specific scalar projection/rounding checks; S sections with additional frozen-only tables use the V fingerprint checks.
